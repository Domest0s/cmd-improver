# cmd-improver
This repo is aimed to improve experience from CMD Windows command prompt.


### Assumed usage
I find very convenient to run this script at any time from command prompt. To make this happen you need to add path to the directory with scripts to Windows PATH environment variable.

### disclamer
Some scripts contain special characters (like escape character ```027```) that is not visible in every editor. I use Notepad++ editor for this purpose.
